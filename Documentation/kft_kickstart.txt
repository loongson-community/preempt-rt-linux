1. kft

kft is short for kernel function tracing, which is a patch for linux kernel, it
can be used to trace the kernel functions from the user
space(dynamically/statically).

be differ from ftrace in rt-preempt, it's not latency tracing, but kernel
function executing time & calling relationship tracing. which can be used to
find out the hotspots for performance optimization.

please read Documentation/kft.txt or the source code of the patch to learn more
about it.

2. usage

2.1 principle

	apps					user functions			<-- cscope,calltree,gprof,gcov..

				---------------system calls-----------

	kernel					kernel functions		<-- kft,ftrace,kgcov...

there are lots of tools to tracing user functions & kernel functions, which are
listed above. but kft, which gives us the possibility "go through" user space
to kernel space.

when executing a user space application, we can use strace to trace the system
calls used by this application, and then configure these system calls as the
filter entries or exites in the configuration file of kft. after them, prime
kft and start your application, the relative kernel functions called by the
relative system calls will be traced, after that, we can try to pry into the
internal of kernel, what have happen, irq, interrupts, kernel calling
relatiionship, kernel executing time. and based on these results, we can do a
lot of we want.

2.2 use it

* download the latest kft patch from ftp://dslab.lzu.edu.cn/pub/kft
* patch kernel with the relative kft patch
* configure it

make sure these options are there:

CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y
CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=y
# CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS is not set
CONFIG_KFT=y
CONFIG_KFT_STATIC_RUN=y

!!!NOTE: currently, kft not work on linux kernel/64bit for loongson2f, so
please compile the kernel in 32bit for loongson2f.

* compile it

when enabling CONFIG_KFT_STATIC_RUN, please do this before compiling:

chmod a+x scripts/mkkftrun.pl

this tool is used to create a kernel/kftstatic.c from kernel/kftstatic.conf

* reboot to the new kernel

* dump the kernel sysmbols

cat /proc/kallsyms > system.map

* write a configuration file

# file: config.sym
new
begin
	trigger start entry sys_open
	trigger stop exit sys_open
end

save this content to a file named config.sym

this configuraiton are used to tracing the sys_open excuting procedure. please
read the Documentation/kft.txt to learn about about the configuration language.

* convert the symbols to address to make kernel comfortable

chmod a+x scripts/sym2addr
./scripts/sym2addr config.sym system.map > config.addr

* feed the configuration file to kernel

cat config.addr > /proc/kft

* prime the kft

echo prime > /proc/kft

* start your program

start your program, which will call the traced system call listed in
configuration file.

* trace the status of kft

cat /proc/kft

if you have found out a word like "completed", dump the data from
/proc/kft_data

* dump the data

cat /proc/kft_data > log.addr

* convert the address to make people comfortable

chmod a+x scripts/addr2sym
./scripts/addr2sym < log.addr -m system.map > log.sym

* analyze it

chmod a+x scripts/kd
./scripts/kd -c -l -i log.sym

please learn more the kd usage from Documentation/kft.txt

there is all, be happy to play with it.
